# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a simple, single-page app for booking interviews.

This app makes use of Node.js for the backend server, and React for the front-end. Unit and integration testing is done using both Storybook and Jest. End-to-End testing is done using Cypress.

# Purpose
In its current state, this SPA allows users to view, book, edit, and cancel any number of interview appointments. Appointments take place between 12PM-4PM local time.

### Responsive Design
The app has been designed to support small and large screens, so you can schedule an interview whether you're on the go or at your desk!
